Most notably even if I have standard matrices in mind when writing the code, my `normalise` will still work if a passed matrix `A` is non-standard, because the fallback `det` will do the job. \n",
    "- As a programmer, writing a custom matrix `A` which adheres to all conventions of the `AbstractMatrix` interface, I instantly have a working `normalise` function even if I could be more clever about it. This way I can rapidly prototype my fancy new matrix type and only later implement the `det` function once I see it's necessary to achieve better performance. Most importantly, however, I can specialise `det` (from `Base`) in my code where I define `A` and *still* the `normalise` function (which could be third-party code) will speed up (more on this below)."

    "This probably does not sound so impressive, but let us discuss this a little further, staying with the example of multiplication. We consider implementing a binary operator `*(n::Float64, str::SparseMatrixCSC)`, which multiplies a number with a sparse matrix in compressed-column storage format:\n",
    "- In many languages such as Python, implementing such a binary operator translates to a special operator function. In the Python case this is `__mul__`, which needs to be implemented for the LHS type, i.e. `Float64`. In other words which method to call for `*` is decided solely by considering the type of the *first* argument, hence the name *single dispatch*.\n",
    "- This is not always the most clever thing to do. In our case one could well argue that `SparseMatrixCSC` should be the place where the operator should be implemented, because the net effect will be to scale this matrix. Amongst other reasons this is why Python rolled out a second set of functions, called `__rmul__`, which dispatch on the *second* argument. Problem solved, right?\n",
    "- Yes, for `*(n::Float64, str::SparseMatrixCSC)` we are good, but a new conceptional problem results. Let's say I want to use a custom floating point format `Double64` in my code and specifically implement `*(n::Double64, str::SparseMatrixCSC)`. Both `Double64` and `SparseMatrixCSC` are from third-party packages, which know nothing from another. In Python I have roughly three options:\n",
    "    1. Implement `__rmul__` in `SparseMatrixCSC`. That's bad because it adds the dependency on `Double64` inside `SparseMatrixCSC`.\n",
    "    2. Implement `__mul__` in `Double64` ... same issue in reverse.\n",
    "    3. Derive off e.g. `SparseMatrixCSC` in my code and implement there. Works, but I have now a part of my library that is closely coupled to the API of `SparseMatrixCSC`. If anything happens in the `SparseMatrixCSC` I have to follow along or my code breaks.\n",
    "- In C++ the very problem of implementing mulitplication is not so prominent, because `operator*` can also be a free function. For other binary operations (like type conversion) the problem is, however, exactly the same: As soon as two non-standard third-party types are involved and my code needs to connect them, I have to make one more special than the other.\n",
