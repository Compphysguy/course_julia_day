    "## Julia: Interdisciplinary science perspective\n",
    "- For software development in interdisciplinary fields like materials science, quantum chemistry, biology, physics and countless others, one problem is to bundle the efforts from all involved research communities.\n",
    "- Problem here is that each field has different methods and approaches, resulting in deviating demands, for example:\n",
    "    - **Mathematicians** often consider reduced models and edge cases\n",
    "    - **Scientists** want to develop scientifically sound models and not worry about numerics\n",
    "    - **Computer scientists** want to gain the best performance for a given hardware\n",
    "    - **Practicioners** want to use the software to understand molecules or materials,\n",
    "      so software should be easy-to-use, reliable and black-box\n",
    "- As a result existing software is often only suitable for the research of some involved communities, but fails to provide a general platform. One example from materials science is that improvements suggested by mathematical analysis (working on the their toy codes) sometimes don't make it into the packages used by practicioners.\n",
    "- I think Julia is well-suited to overcome these challenges of interdisciplinary software development. Both high-level and low-level developments can be jointly underdone and at the same time one is able to design interfaces, which can be used by people less oriented towards programming."

    "## Julia: My wishlist\n",
    "- Better support for more advanced unit tests (test tagging, test selection, fixtures, plugin system for tests)\n",
    "- Better support for static code analysis\n",
    "- Better support for code completion and refactoring in editors (at least in VIM it's still only m√§h to this point)\n",
    "- Package maturity and quality not uniformly distributed amoungst fields ... yet.\n",
    "- I think these aspects are mainly a **question of time** ... the basics are there, but compared e.g. to Python things have not yet developed so much into a stable common ecosystem."

    "- Rich and growing package landscape\n",
    "- Bonus on top: Keep using all your favourite python, R, C, C++ snippets\n",
    "- Open and welcoming community with plenty of places to ask for help\n",
    "- Advantageous language design:\n",
    "    - Code generic by nature\n",
    "    - Multiple dispatch decouples packages (since e.g. it avoids the binary operator problem)\n",
    "    - Risk of \"dependency hell\" well reduced\n",
    "    - ... \n",
    "- Surprisingly small effort to try something, even a cutting-edge features (like GPU, automatic differentiation, mixed precision)\n",
    "- Often combining niche packages, which have certainly never been used jointly, just works out of the box ...\n",
    "    - ... or it takes 1 or 2 simple patches with few-line fixes to get it there"
