    "## Julia: Interdisciplinary science perspective\n",
    "- In interdisciplinary software development for fields like materials science, quantum chemistry, biology, physics and countless others, one problem is to bundle the efforts from the involved fields.\n",
    "- One issue is that each field has different methods and approaches, resulting in deviating demands, for example:\n",
    "    - **Mathematicians** often consider reduced models and edge cases\n",
    "    - **Scientists** want to develop scientifically sound models and not worry about numerics\n",
    "    - **Computer scientists** want to gain the best performance for a given hardware\n",
    "    - **Practicioners** want to use the software to understand molecules or materials,\n",
    "      so software should be easy-to-use, reliable and black-box\n",
    "- As a result existing software is often only suitable for the research of one community, but fails to provide a general platform. E.g. mathematical methods sometimes don't make it to the praciticioner.\n",
    "- For me one of the key advantages of Julia is here its ability to allow for high-level and low-level development in one package, making it highly suitable especially for interdisciplinary software projects."

    "## Julia: My wishlist\n",
    "- Better support for more advanced unit tests (test tagging, test selection, fixtures, plugin system for tests)\n",
    "- Better support for static code analysis\n",
    "- Better support for code completion and refactoring in editors (at least in VIM it's still only m√§h to this point)\n",
    "- Package maturity and quality not uniformly distributed amoungst fields, but ... that's not such a big problem (see below)\n",
    "- **Important:** These aspects are mainly a question of time ... the basics are there, but compared e.g. to Python it could be better."

    "- Rich and expanding package landscape\n",
    "- Bonus on top: Keep using all your favourite python, R, C, C++ snippets\n",
    "- Open and welcoming community with plenty of places to ask for help\n",
    "- Advantageous language design:\n",
    "    - Code generic by nature\n",
    "    - Multiple dispatch decouples packages (since e.g. it avoids the binary operator problem)\n",
    "    - Risk of \"dependency hell\" well reduced\n",
    "- Surprisingly small effort to use cutting-edge features (automatic differentiation, mixed precision, GPU)\n",
    "- Often niche packages, which have never been used jointly just work ...\n",
    "    - ... or it takes 1 or 2 simple patches with one-line fixes to get it done"

    "- High-level language, good for rapid prototyping\n",
    "- First **prototype has adequate speed** to go beyond simplistic test cases\n",
    "- Tools to inspect, benchmark and profile (`BenchmarkTools`, `Profile`, `@code_llvm`, `@code_native`)\n",
    "- Tricks to selectively optimise performance (`@threads`, `@inbounds`, `@views`, `@simd`)\n",
    "- **Philosophy:** First get it to work, then **make it fast**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combination of strong type system and just-in-time compilation:\n",
    "    - Code can be written generically\n",
    "    - User can mark specifics about his problem in the form of types (e.g. symmetric matrix, positive-definiteness ...)\n",
    "    - Enables short-cuts and dynamic switching to better optimisations\n",
    "    - Dead code and branches may be eliminated\n",
    "- Machine-specific optimisations can be used ... even on inhomogeneous clusters with nodes of different processor generations\n",
    "- **Philosophy:** Write code once, but **reuse** it many times"
